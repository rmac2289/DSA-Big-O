1. 
    1. Constant time
    2. Polynomial time
2. Linear - the code will be run through one time, dividing each number by 2 - the 
    time for each calculation remains constant. Time is directly proportional to size of input.
3. Polynomial time - An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping over an input would be O(n^2)
4. Linear - Time is directly proportional to size of input.
5. Linear - Time is directly proportional to size of input.
6. Polynomial time - An algorithm that requires 2 levels of looping over an input would be O(n^2)
7. For numbers between 1 and the input #, if the # equals 1 it pushes '0' to an empty array, if # equals 2 it pushes '1' to the array, else it pushes index (#-2) + (# - 3) to the array. Exponential time
8. Logarithmic time - this example allows the array to be cut in half during each loop, greatly cutting down the time 
9. Constant time - size of the input does not matter, random element will be picked out in same amount of time
10. The function returns false if the number is less than 2, if not it returns true. The 2nd condition in the first if statement is unnecessary as is the entire for loop. 
11. I had to look this up online, I was unable to come up with the solution on my own.
